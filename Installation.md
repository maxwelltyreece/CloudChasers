# Instructions ~ Maxwell

I did this all on Windows so if you're using Mac you may need to run different commands or install different versions.




## Installation

Install these:

node - https://nodejs.org/en/download

on your phone ->
ExpoGo (So you can run the development server on your device)

ReactNativePaper (An app that lets you see the different components for the component library I added to the project)

Once you clone the project from github, run these commands

```bash
  cd CloudChasers # make sure you are in the second directory
  npm install
  npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code on your device and it should open in ExpoGo (Might be different if you have an android)
